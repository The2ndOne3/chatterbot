        h1 Meet Chatterbot
        p Say hello to the world's first voice-controlled AI chat bot (you know, besides that other thing Apple made). Chatterbot is based on an open sourced version of Dr. Richard Wallace's <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_Linguistic_Internet_Computer_Entity'>ALICE bot</a>, a highly intelligent talking robot originally created in 1995.
        p Try talking to Chatterbot, asking it pressing questions, and learning from it the meaning of life. (Disclaimer: we can neither confirm nor deny that Chatterbot indeed knows the meaning of life, but you should probably go outside or something if that's what you're looking for)
        h2 Instructions
        p Press the microphone button at the top right and allow the application to use your computer's microphone to enable voice recognition. Speak loudly and clearly into your microphone while assuring passersby that you're not insane. You will get the best results in a quiet environment. By default, speech synthesis is enabled: Chatterbot talks back! For those of you who enjoy mute friends, clicking the speaker button will disable voice output. A text transcript of your conversation will always be shown on the screen.
        h3 Usage Notes
        p Make sure to keep your speakers away from the microphone as this can cause Chatterbot to start talking to itself, unless you want to Chatterbot to actually talk to itself, in which case turn your speakers up and place them right next to the microphone. (Clinical trials* have shown that this is hilarious 60% of the time, all the time) 
          small *Clinical trials have not actually shown this.
        p This application's speech recognition is not perfect, and you will probably encounter textual errors in your conversation. Your mileage may vary.
        p In order to enter punctuation, simply speak them at the end of your words, eg. "comma", "period", "exclamation mark", and "question mark" while assuring passersby that you're really not insane.
        p The microphone will automatically turn off after a short period of inactivity or a prolonged period of use.
